# minilibx_key_checker
A very simple program that return the code from a pressed key using minilix library.

I wrote this to help me with so_long project from 42!

Install dependencies:
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xorg libxext-dev zlib1g-dev libbsd-dev

And then just run make and then ./key_checker.

To exit the program just CTRL + C at terminal.
